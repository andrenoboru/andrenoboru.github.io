# This is the data of my blog

Here you can see all the files of my personal blog. It is hosted by [GitHub](http://github.com) and **automagically** transformed by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) into a static site whenever I push this repository.

With this blog, I want to exercise my writing and develop skills at the same time. You can find it at <http://andrenoboru.com>.
